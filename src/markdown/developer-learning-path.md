 ## I thought I knew how it worked

Even though like most programmers I have never attended any computer science course, my first coding experience was somewhat related to an academic curriculum. I therefore naively came to think, that making computers do stuff was a science, that it involved some mathematical skills and that this was something you could learn from a textbook.

This belief grew strong during my first internship as every Friday afternoon we had a workshop introducing a design pattern from the gang of four.

Like I said I was not a computer science guy and after this internship, I took a job that had nothing to do with software development. Since then I only coded once in a while as a hobby.
A few years ago bored to death by my day job I decided to get more serious with coding, hoping that it could help me find another job.

## I started to learn forward

I discovered [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) and kind of became addicted to these online courses. As there were opportunities in my field, I finally made it to a c# junior developer position.
I had taken some MVC 5 courses, got acquainted with Web API, Entity code first and the TPL. 

I had even begun gathering some info on the brand new dotnet core. I was convinced with the necessity of unit testing, that every application had to implement some kind of repository pattern and should embed some IOC container üç®

## Then I met the production code :)

And suddenly my learning path took a different direction ... 
I realized by how much the actual code may defer from what you see written in tutorials.

It is not just that the code base is a bit messy, but if you work on a code that has been started ten years ago, chances are that you will meet technologies from ten years ago and that you will have to learn about those.

You cannot find any tutorial on Udemy about WCF ( there still is a good one for that very topic on Pluralsight though), linq2Sql or webforms. A teacher would not sell such courses, yet they still are industry standards.
The journey to keep on learning becomes chaotic, but it can only be more fun that way, right?
