I therefore naively came to think, that making computers do stuff was a science, that it involved some mathematical skills and that this was something you could learn from a textbook.</p>\n<p>This belief grew strong during my first internship as every Friday afternoon we had a workshop introducing a design pattern from the gang of four.</p>\n<p>Like I said I was not a computer science guy and after this internship, I took a job that had nothing to do with software development. Since then I only coded once in a while as a hobby.\nA few years ago bored to death by my day job I decided to get more serious with coding, hoping that it could help me find another job.</p>\n<h2>I started to learn forward</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Diego Jimenez on Unsplash\"\n        title=\"Photo by Diego Jimenez on Unsplash\"\n        src=\"/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/c739e/road.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/8ee9c/road.jpg 148w,\n/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/ebbe7/road.jpg 295w,\n/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/c739e/road.jpg 590w,\n/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/5413e/road.jpg 885w,\n/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/4efde/road.jpg 1180w,\n/erizo-dev-blog/static/a12e6bc96cad2a081e98b5e1c1a5ff6b/49286/road.jpg 5472w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>I discovered <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com\">Pluralsight</a> and kind of became addicted to these online courses.
